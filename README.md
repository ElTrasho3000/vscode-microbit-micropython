# VScode micro:bit-MicroPython Extension

This extension provides a self-contained developing environment for developing with _MicroPython_ for the _micro:bit_ platform.

It allows to initialize a project with an optional template example, to upload a python _sketch_ (I am borrowing Processing's terminology) on the micro:bit, or to remove/get files from the micro:bit file system.

For a tutorial of how to use this extension, please take a look at this [video](link).
